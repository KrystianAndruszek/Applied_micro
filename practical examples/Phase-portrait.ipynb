    "A Phase portrait represents a direction field of first-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) or system of two first-order ODE's. Plotdf function was originally implemented in maxima but it is also possible to create such a plot with matplotlib package or plotdf package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotdf package in python is inspired by maxima's plotdf function, thanks to that we will not waste time to do it manually with matplotlib.\n",

    "\n",
    "> The plotdf command may include several commands, each command is a list of two or more items. The first item is the name of the option, and the remainder comprises the value or values assigned to the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The options which are recognized by plotdf are the following:**\n",
    "> - tstep defines the length of the increments on the independent variable t, used to compute an integral curve. If only one expression dydx is given to plotdf, the x variable will be directly proportional to t. The default value is 0.1.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - nsteps defines the number of steps of length tstep that will be used for the independent variable, to compute an integral curve. The default value is 100.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - direction defines the direction of the independent variable that will be followed to compute an integral curve. Possible values are forward, to make the independent variable increase nsteps times, with increments tstep, backward, to make the independent variable decrease, or both that will lead to an integral curve that extends nsteps forward, and nsteps backward. The keywords right and left can be used as synonyms for forward and backward. The default value is both.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - tinitial defines the initial value of variable t used to compute integral curves. Since the differential equations are autonomous, that setting will only appear in the plot of the curves as functions of t. The default value is 0.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - versus_t is used to create a second plot window, with a plot of an integral curve, as two functions x, y, of the independent variable t. If versus_t is given any value different from 0, the second plot window will be displayed. The second plot window includes another menu, similar to the menu of the main plot window. The default value is 0.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - trajectory_at defines the coordinates xinitial and yinitial for the starting point of an integral curve. The option is empty by default.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - parameters defines a list of parameters, and their numerical values, used in the definition of the differential equations. The name and values of the parameters must be given in a string with a comma-separated sequence of pairs name=value.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - sliders defines a list of parameters that will be changed interactively using slider buttons, and the range of variation of those parameters. The names and ranges of the parameters must be given in a string with a comma-separated sequence of elements name=min:max\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - xfun defines a string with semi-colon-separated sequence of functions of x to be displayed, on top of the direction field. Those functions will be parsed by Tcl and not by Maxima.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - x should be followed by two numbers, which will set up the minimum and maximum values shown on the horizontal axis. If the variable on the horizontal axis is not x, then this option should have the name of the variable on the horizontal axis. The default horizontal range is from -10 to 10.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - y should be followed by two numbers, which will set up the minimum and maximum values shown on the vertical axis. If the variable on the vertical axis is not y, then this option should have the name of the variable on the vertical axis. The default vertical range is from -10 to 10.\n",
